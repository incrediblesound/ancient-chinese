Ancient Chinese
===============
I thought I might share my knowledge of Ancient Chinese with the git world for two reasons:    
1) Github is a vast, awesome repository of knowledge full of amazing people    
2) Ancient Chines is a vast, awesome repository of knowledge full of amazing people    

Given these two highly distinct factors in combination with my desire to not waste an expensive master's degree the decision to act was easily made. As I started to work I realized how wasteful it is to write a highly organized book without any markup whatsoever. Thusly I decided to distinguish the various parts of the book using xml, and to use JavaScript to format the content. Seeing the result I was greatly pleased, and wondered why anyone would ever write a book without using markup to make it computer readable.
